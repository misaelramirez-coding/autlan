    "Something important to consider in the forecast is the COVID-19 factor, which is why we arrive to the conclusion that it could a few years for the economy to go back to normal levels. Although it is important to mention a huge advantage and it is the fact that this economic slowdown wasn't caused by a financial crisis or something related to it, it was entirely an extra-ordinary situation which then affected the economy. This explains why the recvoery has showed fast results. Despite this, this process of recovery could take a couple more years\n",

    "* Manganese: most of its drivers are at a macroeconomic level, because of that, the COVID-19 affects it in a negative way\n",
    "* Precious Metals (Gold): most of its drivers are also macroeconomic, but it reacts the other way around since it is anticyclal as it was previously mentioned\n",
    "* As a result, manganese sales show a decrease while there are succesful sales in gold. \n",
    "* By they way, we must consider that 83% of Autlán's operations represent the extraction of Manganese, this proportions might be widely affected since manganese and gold act in different directions against economic performance \n",

    "## Forecast 2021\n",
    "The gradient (**`0.83`**) considered for this year on both sales represents the slow economic recovery which will start to grow and get its highest probably at the end of the year. It is important to clarify that the gradient is different than the actual variables which are displayed in the second table in decimals. Since we expect no temporary close which would affect both divisions and volume doesn't decline because of that, the economic recovery is inminent. The hard part of 2021 is caused by the economic slowdown itself and the fact that the company will take sometime to adapt its new operations volume and change its plans to save as much expenses as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forecast 2022\n",
    "The second gradient is the **`base`. The base quantity are the raw calculation of mangananese sales and gold sales; `$ 315.9` and `$ 104.22` respectively** which we calculated for FY20 but we had to modify, we considered this base values to be FY20 is the COVID factor wouldn't have appeared. This changes affect both divisions as society is starting to work the way it is supposed to after two years of the tragedy, although we might expect to leave some measures and protocols to stick for a few more years, especially the ones related with higiene.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forecast (2023-2025)\n",
    "This is what we would call the economic stability and where the markets and base rules such as supply and demand follow the roots of their concept; shortly, a normal economy. As a result, we decided to define a constant gradient for the next three years: **`0.98`**. Nonetheless, it works differently for both divisions. Since the economy is reaching stabilty which based on previous status this will can be considered economic flourishment. As a result, the gradient will act as a cyclical and anticyclical, it will be applied as **`-0.98`** for gold since people start to invest in other vehicules and **`+0.98`** now that steel production, demand and ferroalloys exports come into play as main indicators of high economic movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are considering that there won't be a second wave, if that would be the case, the situation would be different and it requires other type of criteria\n",
