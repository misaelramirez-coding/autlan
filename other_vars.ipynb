    "3. *Precious Metals*\n",

    "> \"The electricity generation of the Atexcaco hydroelectric plant was favored by the constant flow of water during the dry months, so its generation grew 56%, contributing 30% of Autlán's needs and representing savings in the first half of the year of 40.2 million MXN\"\n",

The percentage of COGS does not vary a lot over time (not even the gradient for FY20 which comes from forecasted numbers, COGS and Sales respectively), and this can be seen in its variance over time, which is `5.2415`, considering that we are considering millions of dollars, it doesn't change as much.\n",
